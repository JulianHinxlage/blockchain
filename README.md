# Blockchain

This project is a comprehensive implementation of a blockchain system. It includes core functionalities for creating, managing, and securing a blockchain network, alongside advanced features such as Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus, cryptographic utilities, network communication, and wallet management.

## Key Features
- Blockchain Core

    - Transaction Processing: Create, validate, and process transactions on the blockchain.
    - Block Creation and Verification: Efficiently create new blocks and verify their integrity.
    - Account Management: Handle user accounts, including balance and stake tracking.
    - Consensus Mechanism: Implement Proof of Stake (PoS) to secure the network and validate transactions.

- Cryptography

    - Common cryptographic algorithms including AES, Eliptic Cryptography, PBKDF2 and SHA, using OpenSSL

- Network Communication

    - Peer-to-Peer Network: Manage peer connections and data exchange in a decentralized manner.
    - Network Error Handling: Robust error handling for network operations.

- Storage

    - Key-Value Storage: Efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.
    - KeyStore Management: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys.

- Utilities

    - Logging: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
    - Serialization: Efficiently serialize and deserialize data for network transmission and storage.
    - Thread Management: Manage concurrent operations with threaded queues and utilities.

- Wallet

    - Wallet Management: Create and manage wallets for storing and transacting cryptocurrencies.
    - User Interface: User-friendly interface for interacting with the wallet.

- Validator

    - Blockchain Validation: Validate the integrity and correctness of the blockchain.
    - Consensus Participation: Participate in the Proof of Stake consensus process.
